Thoughts

This was a project that was completed during an independent study in programming iOS applications. Most of this project was written 
with a textbook aid however there were additional features assigned to me that I implemented myself. These features were the ability 
to favorite certain photos and view them separately, adding a view count to the photos, and allowing for the cell size to change dynamically. 
Throughout this class I learned how to program inside Apple's sandbox, and got familiar with a new language in the process.
